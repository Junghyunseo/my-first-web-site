<h2>Hyunseo's OHP</h2>
The overhead press, also known as the shoulder press or military press, is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the trainee presses a weight overhead while seated or standing.
<br>It is mainly used to develop the anterior deltoid muscles of the shoulder.
<br>The standing version was once a component of the sport of Olympic weightlifting as part of the clean and press movement, but was removed in 1972 due to difficulties in judging proper technique.
