<h2>Hyunseo's Big Three</h2>
Here is Hyunseo's big three (Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift)
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)" target="_blank" title="Squat specification">Squat</a>: 200kg(1rm), 185kg(3rm), 180kg(4rm), 175kg(5rm)
<br>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up.
<br>During the descent, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes;
<br>conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up. Squats also help the hip muscles.
<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_press" target="_blank" title="Bench Press specification">Bench Press</a>: 115kg(1rm), 102.5kg(5rm)
<br>The bench press, or chest press, is a weight training exercise where a person presses a weight upwards while lying horizontally on a weight training bench.
<br>Although the bench press is a compound movement, the muscles primarily used are the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles.
<br>A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.
<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlift" target="_blank" title="Deadlift specification">Deadlift</a>: 210kg(1rm), 200(3rm), 195(5rm)
<br>The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, torso perpendicular to the floor,before being placed back on the ground.
<br>It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press, as well as a frequent lift in strongman.
